Blog posts are a great way to engage with the scientific community, explore ideas, and share your interests with a broader community. 

You are welcome to contribute to the [Seedscape Blog](https://seedscapeblog.wordpress.com/). If your writing is related to seed dispersal, this will also be posted to [CoDisperse blog](http://codisperse.weebly.com/blog), and if your writing is related to research in Latin America, this will be translated to Spanish and be posted to [Verde Elemental](http://verde-elemental.org/).

Potential topics include:

1. Attend a seminar, read one of the speaker's papers, and meet with them. Types of questions that could be addressed:
* What kinds of research questions do they focus on?
* What results have they found? 
* What do they find most interesting in their work or career?
* What was their academic journey - how did they get to where they are now?
* What career or research advice do they have?

2. Summaries of your research progress:
* Stories from the field
* Stories in the adventures of modeling
* Summarize and synthesize results from your literature search. Write about a few related papers that you find interesting.

3. Career related posts

4. Summaries of conferences, workshops, etc. 

5. Make a video explaining your research ([an example](https://youtu.be/r6sij88BCMk)) or your research project ([some examples](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvGeUl4r0EYvjV3lZBiSRkw/videos?view_as=subscriber)) and blog about it!
