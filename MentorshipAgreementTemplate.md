I have read and provided feedback on the general guidelines and the code of conduct of the Seedscape Ecology Research Group. I recognize this is a living document created by and for the research group to support an inclusive community in which everyone can thrive. As such, I will actively contribute to the revision of these policies throughout my tenure in the group to ensure that they reflect the values and expectations of the current group. Revisions will be discussed and agreed upon as a group.
