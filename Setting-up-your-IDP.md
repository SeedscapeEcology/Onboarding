# Individual Development Plan Summary

:memo: Developing an Individual Development Plan will guide you towards your career goals. You will acquire the skills and experience you need by setting achievable short- and intermediate-term goals.

:alarm_clock: I would also suggest you adopt a time management tool to help you manage your time and ensure you are continuously advancing your goals. There's a variety of different methods for time management, and if you have an approach that works for you, please share them with the group! Currently, Noelle is using an approach developed by Dr. Karin Kettering to keep track of short- and long-term research goals on a weekly basis - ask Noelle to see it.

## Building your IDP

Fill out one of the following templates: the [templates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6jsUuSJqdDaUjJpQUV6X2VWMGc/view) provided in this [guide for undergraduates](https://medium.com/stem-and-culture-chronicle/building-your-individual-development-plan-idp-a-guide-for-undergraduate-students-f14feca9111c) by Dr. Bosch Guide, the template for [graduate students](https://www.unl.edu/gradstudies/current/development/idp) or [postdocs](https://postdoc.unl.edu/current/idp_review/) provided by the University of Nebraska, or the [web-based career-planning tool](http://myidp.sciencecareers.org/) provided by *Science*, and share the results with Noelle in one of your initial meetings. Also see advice on goal setting from [USU's Academic Success Center](https://www.usu.edu/asc/assistance/pdf/goal_setting.pdf).

## Summarize your IDP
Create a file in the [Project Management](https://github.com/SeedscapeEcology/ProjectManagement) repository called `IDP.md` inside a folder with your name (don't put a space, use a hypen to separate your first and last name(s)). This will be the same folder in which you add your weekly reflections.

Inside that file, copy the template below that summarizes your IDP results. It's in markdown format and you might find this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) useful for getting started. [Note: replace each instance of day and month under table of contents and after "Date:" with the actual the day and month.

```
## Table of Contents
* [Day Month 2017](#date-day-month-2017)

## Date: Day Month 2017

#### Long-term Goals
What additional milestones or skills do you need within your program to advance your career goals that will take longer than a year?
<table border="1" cellpadding="8">

Alternatively, you could use the following template for **Long-term Goals** developed by Sarah Bogen (code below):

<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td> <b>Skill or Tool</b> </td> <td> <b> Recent progress and overall status </b> </td>
<td> <b> Planned progress for current semester </b> </td>
<td> <b> Future progress </b> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Skill 1 </td> 
<td>
  <ul>
    <li> Progress A </li>
    <li> Progress B </li>
  </ul>
  Overall status: Much better!
</td>
<td> 
  <ul>
    <li> Current Progress A </li>
    <li> Current Progress B </li>
  </ul>
</td>
<td>
  <ul>
    <li> Future progress </li>
  </ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Skill 2 </td>
<td>
  <ul>
    <li> Progress A </li>
    <li> Progress B </li>
  </ul>
  Overall status: No progress
</td>
<td> 
  <ul>
    <li> Current Progress </li>
  </ul> 
</td>
<td> 
  <ul>
    <li> Future Progress A </li>
    <li> Future Progress B </li>
  </ul> 
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Code for above template
```
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
